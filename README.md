Multi-repository composition governance for ordered CANONIC machine systems.

## Governance Path

**inherits:** `/`

## Purpose

STACK defines the composition of multiple CANONIC machines into a single ordered system. It manages relationships between machines without altering their internal governance, aggregates ledger instances into unified views, and preserves machine boundaries across the stack.

---

## In Scope

- Composition of multiple CANONIC machines
- Ledger aggregation across repositories
- Deterministic ordering of machines and ledgers
- Visibility enforcement (public, private, local)
- Referential navigation between stack members
- Repository isolation requirements

## Out of Scope

- Internal machine governance
- Execution or enforcement semantics
- Modification of machine-local CANON or LEDGER state
