# STACK

The composition layer for multiple CANONIC machines.

---

## Overview

STACK aggregates multiple LEDGER instances into a unified, ordered multi-ledger view without introducing governance or altering machine-local state.

---

## Membership

Public membership is open; see `public/STACK.yml` for the tracked repositories.

A private overlay may include closed repositories. STACK is observational: it records membership but does not govern member behavior.

Enforcement is a private role; its outcomes appear in the ledger.

## Triad

- `CANON.md` — governance axioms
- `VOCAB.md` — content concept definitions
- `README.md` — this file
